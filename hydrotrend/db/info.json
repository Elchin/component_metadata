  "summary": "HydroTrend is a climate-driven hydrological water balance and transport model that simulates water discharge and sediment load at a river outlet. HydroTrend simulates water and sediment fluxes at a daily timescale based on drainage basin characteristics and climate. HydroTrend can provide river flux information to other components like CEM, Sedflux2D, and Sedflux3D.",
