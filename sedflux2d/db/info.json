  "summary":"Sedflux2D is a basin-filling stratigraphic model. Sedflux2D simulates longterm marine sediment transport and accumulation into a two-dimensional longitudinal basin over time scales of tens of thousands of years. It simulates the dynamics of strata formation of continental margins and includes turbidity currents and debris flows.",
