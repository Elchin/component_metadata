  "summary": "This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model. It uses the "diffusive wave" method to compute flow velocities for all of the channels in a D8-based river network. This wave method is similar to the kinematic wave method for modeling flow in open channels, but instead of a simple balance between friction and gravity, this method includes the pressure gradient that is induced by a water-depth gradient in the downstream direction. This means that instead of using bed slope in Manning's equation or the law of the wall, the water-surface slope is used. One consequence of this is that water is able to move across flat areas that have a bed slope of zero. Local and convective accelerations in the momentum equations are still neglected, just as is done in the kinematic wave method.",
