  "summary": "This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model. TopoFlow supports three different types of flow diversions: sources, sinks and canals. Sources are locations such as natural springs where water enters the watershed at a point by some process other than those that are otherwise modeled. Similarly, sinks are locations where water leaves the watershed at a point. Canals are generally man-made reaches such as tunnels or irrigation ditches that transport water from one point to another, typically without following the natural gradient of the terrain that is indicated by the DEM. The upstream end is essentially a sink and the downstream end a source.",
