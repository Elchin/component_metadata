  "summary": "The Coastline Evolution Model addresses predominately sandy, wave-dominated coastlines on time scales ranging from years to millenia and on spatial scales ranging from kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. CEM simulates planview coastline evolution due to wave-driven alongshore sediment transport. This model can incorporate river influence and transport fluvial sediment from one or more point sources along the coastline.",
