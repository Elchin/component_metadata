  "summary": "GC2D is a two-dimensional finite difference numerical model that is driven by a calculations of glacier mass balance (snow precipitation - melt rate). The model calculates ice surface elevations above a two-dimensional terrain by solving equations for ice flux and mass conservation using explicit methods.",
