  "summary": "This component reads a variety of variables for the atmosphere and for the land surface from input files or as simple scalars. It then computes many additional variables, such as vapor pressure, eair, and net shortwave (solar) radiation, QSW, using built-in shortwave and longwave radiation calculators that are based on celestial mechanics and widely-used empirical relationships. These additional variables are needed by the Snowmelt → Energy Balance and Evaporation → Energy Balance components. Direct, diffuse and back-scattered radiation fluxes are all modeled. Properties of the atmosphere (e.g. precipitation rate, P, air temperature, Tair, relative humidity, RH, and dust attenuation, γ), are used as well as surface/topographic properties (e.g. slope angle, aspect angle and surface albedo). The approach used here closely follows the one outlined in Appendix E of Dingman (2002). However, instantaneous vs. day-integrated radiation fluxes are used and the optical air mass is modeled using the widely used method of Kasten and Young (1989).",
