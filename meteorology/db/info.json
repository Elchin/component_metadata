  "summary": "Meteorology is a process component for TopoFlow, a D8-based, spatial hydrologic model. TopoFlow attempts to model many different physical processes in a watershed with the goal of accurately predicting how various hydrologic variables will evolve in time in response to climatic forcings. Meteorology can be used within TopoFlow, or as a stand-alone model.",
